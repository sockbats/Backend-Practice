# Backend Practice

This is just a repo to learn and practice various backend languages and frameworks.

Database folder includes the SQL script to create the DB tables, a python script to post the data (from Web Scraper) 
to the backend, and a python test file to test the endpoints.

The Web Scraper is what gets the data to be posted to the backend.

There is currently no frontend to recieve the data.

## Current Backend Implementations
* Java
  * Uses the com.sun.net.httpserver package to handle requests
